# Summary
This Shiny App intended to show that for any specific hour, how many shooting incidents have occurred in the City of Los Angeles, 
when and where the incident took place.  

I am doing this because it is interesting to see the shooting related crimes have a different patterns over time and place.
For example: there appears to be less shooting related crime during 6~8 AM than any other time.

I hope this yield insights to the group of people who have interest in looking into the relevant data, and 
potentially get values out of this Shiny App.
